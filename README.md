## Overview

This is a solution to the [Results summary component on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). A basic task of creating a result component that has responsibe mobile views.

## My process

Started with structuring the component, putting everything into appripriate containers and tags. Then I worked on the visual styling, such as fonts and colors, shapes and general layout. I did the more refined layout with spacing, padding, and flow for desktop view first. Finally, worked on responsive mobile view. Then added some animation keyframes for fun.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Became more aquainted with responsive designing, and some flex-box positioning, though still not quite as intuitive as I want it to be. Still, felt more like I was crafting with CSS than fighting with CSS. 

### Continued development

Would love include some JavaScript interaction with this, such as getting the results from the JSON rather than hard-coding it, and implenting animation counters, fill bars, to really liven up the project.
